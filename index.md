Welcome! My name is Jeongeon (<i>Jeong-on</i> <a id="plain-bg" href="https://www.howtopronounce.com/jeongeon/36191893">🗣️</a>) Park, and I am a researcher at the <a id="blue-bg" href="https://diag.kr/">DGIST Intelligence Augmentation Group (DIAG)</a>, working with <a id="blue-bg" href="https://jyskwon.github.io/">Prof. Jean Y. Song</a> and the members of DIAG. <br/>
I recently graduated from <a id="blue-bg" href="https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/">School of Computing @ KAIST</a> with a Master's Degree, where I was part of the <a id="blue-bg" href="http://kixlab.org">KAIST Interaction Lab (KIXLAB)</a> led by <a id="blue-bg" href="https://juhokim.com/">Prof. Juho Kim</a>.

<p>
My research interest is in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Human-AI Interaction (HAI), and Social Computing. 
In particular, I am interested in supporting individuals and groups to <b>effectively navigate, comprehend, and utilize information on the web</b> in connection to their unique preferences and contexts, through designing and building AI-infused interactive systems. 
</p> 

<p>
These days, I am investigating how we could foster collaboration between human(s) and agent(s), particularly in the context of academic speech rehearsal.
<!-- interested in the idea of human-agent(s) collaboration, and is investigating how simulated audiences through LLM could aid academic speech practice. 
I am looking into the domain of academic speech rehearsal, and how simula in the following keywords: large-language model (LLM), multiple conversational agents, and feedback generation.-->

I am interested in supporting people to <b>effectively navigate, comprehend, and utilize information</b> in tasks and contexts that requires <b>complex information or opinions</b>. 
By designing and building interactive systems with AI techniques and/or crowdsourcing, 
I aim to not only support the process to be more efficient but also enhance the confidence and long-term abilities of people in long-term.
