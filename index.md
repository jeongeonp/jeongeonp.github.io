<p>
Welcome! My name is Jeongeon (pronounced <i>Jeong-on</i> <a href="https://www.howtopronounce.com/jeongeon/36191893">🗣️</a>) Park, and I am a researcher at the <a href="https://diag.kr/">DGIST Intelligence Augmentation Group (DIAG)</a>, working with <a href="https://jyskwon.github.io/">Prof. Jean Y. Song</a> and the members of DIAG. <br/>
I recently graduated from <a href="https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/">School of Computing @ KAIST</a> with a Master's Degree, where I was part of the <a href="http://kixlab.org">KAIST Interaction Lab (KIXLAB)</a> led by <a href="https://juhokim.com/">Prof. Juho Kim</a>.
</p>

<p>

I am interested in supporting people to <b>effectively navigate, comprehend, and utilize information</b> in tasks and contexts that requires <b>complex information or opinions</b>. To do so, I design and build interactive systems that leverage large-scale crowdsourced information and AI techniques. </p> <p>
These days, I am particularly interested in the following keywords: conversational user interface (CUI), large-language model (LLM), conversational agents, and decision-making support.

I aim to not only support the process to be more efficient but also enhance the confidence and long-term abilities of people in long-term.-->

<p>
My most recent project aimed to support unfamiliar decision-making by designing multi-agent conversational interactions powered by LLMs.
