<h2>Music 🎵</h2>

After coming to grad school, I got into Pokémon... especially collecting Pokémon cards! Since then, whenever I see a card shop, I can't resist the urge to stop by and get a pack of cards to open 😅

</p>

Below are some of my favorite cards :)

I started playing the clarinet since 4th grade in elementary school. Throughout high school, I was a part of the symphonic band and the marching band, which was the highlight of my high school years. <br/> <br/>

Sharing some of my favorite pieces. Thankfully the recordings are available:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://youtu.be/fIJGbzGmNio?si=bX_xuOz_S_FslIsP">Bells for Stokowski</a>: This one's my all-time favorite. 
    </li>
    <li> 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/SJn4baHX2EE?si=KOp0oqvD8Uh0LyPx">Sleigh Ride</a>: We used to play this song as the last piece of winter concert every year. Everyone would get excited during the music and start rushing until the end. A super fun piece to play!
    </li>
    <li> 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/UVvaxD123lg?si=zPrUJPZ4ZqSJqniU">Marching Band Show 2015-16</a>: The music and the performance was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banksy">Banksy</a>, a famous UK street artist. 
    </li>

    <li> 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/CasE9ix7088?si=nmn_hy7_9OW6g542">Fight song</a>: On game days, we would march down the hallway playing this song.
    </li>

Recently I joined <a href="https://intermissionatucsd.org/">The Intermission Orchestra (TIO)</a>, a student-run orchestra at UC San Diego. The students arrange and conduct their own music, and put on concerts every quarter! It feels great to be able to casually play the clarinet again.
<br/> <br/>

In addition to clarinet, I played many other instruments in the past: piano 🎹, harmonica (two at the same time!) 🪗, erhu (二胡) 🪕, and drum 🥁. Music motivates, comforts, and inspires me in so many ways.
